### 1. Recipe Distribution by Main Protein

On the **“Which menu for you”** page, the app displays a Plotly **bar chart** that shows how many recipes belong to each main protein group, for example:

- Pork  
- Beef  
- Prawn  
- Chicken  
- Fish  
- Other  

This chart is generated by querying the recipes stored in DuckDB and counting how often each protein type appears in the recipe data. This gives users a quick overview of which types of dishes are most common in the dataset.
